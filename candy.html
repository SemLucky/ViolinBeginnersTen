            <p id="little">Since this website  was created, I've been playing the violin for about two years - so I know what it's like to have just started. I have also worked with some beginner musicians so I know what to look out for, and what beginners should know. This is why I'm making this website for you, here i'll show 10 things beginner violinists should know. These are also good tips for any and all violinists of course - Even advanced players might need these reminders.</p>

            <h1 id="TEN">10. Always Take Care of Your Instrument</h1>
            <img id="Shiny" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVzm6j4XsAEZjWh.jpg">
            <p id="ignorant">Many kids ignore the fact that having a violin means <b>you need to take care of it</b>, and so what happens later on is they damage their violin and might have to pay extra to get it fixed. Make sure to keep your violin clean, wipe off any rosin dust on the fingerboard and strings. Don't leave your violin out in a <i>cold</i> or <i>hot</i> area, it could make it out of tune or damage your strings and the wood. Don't be ignorant, when not playing make sure your violin is in a place where it won't accidently fall or break in any way be <b>delicate</b> with it. When you finish playing make sure to <u>loosen</u> your bow. When for example a teacher talks about how to take care of your instrument, take it seriously and listen because later on you'll either be upset with a repair bill or you'll be glad you're not the kid with the repair bill.</p><br>

            <img id="Fingers" src="https://media.swncdn.com/cms/CW/family/Teens/13744-violin-fiddle-wide.1200w.tn.jpg">
            <p id="Position">You must've heard a lot of this pharse when working with a teacher "Be prepared" or "whenever you're ready", these mean more than you think - Firstly, of course - be sure your violin is tuned (An online violin tuner is at the top of the page linked to a image), make sure your bow is rosined, have your shoulder rest on your violin, and be focused. After you're instrument is prepared, you yourself need to be prepared by <b>knowing what your about to do</b> - Before playing remember what you've been working on, is it the finger placement? Or your bow hand? Take even a couple of minutes to be prepared before playing your first note and make sure everything you have been working on is implemented into what your about to play - Practicing is very good but <i>practicing wrong</i> is going to waste you a lot of time.</p><br>

            <h1 id="EIGHT">8. Learn The History of Musical Composers</h1>
            <img id="Composer" src="https://dnan0fzjxntrj.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/9/2/6292_niccolopaganini_666457.jpg">
            <p id="History">Who is this person on the left? It is <abbr title="A very famous Italian Violinist"><b>Nicollo Paganini</b></abbr> who is one of the most known violinists today. Overtime you will start learning about the composers of the music your playing, you will start learning about what specific style to play your music because it is different each new generation of music. Learning about history overall is very important but why do you need to learn about these people if all your doing is playing the violin? The notes on your paper? I'll tell you. Each year something original is being added to music, but what happens to the past? Not nothing, it's being implemented into todays playing too! Back then there were different ways you were supposed to play, certain vibrato - there was even 'long staccato' aside from the regular so by learning about the people of the music your playing you'll know the way the composers wanted their piece to be played. Once in a while, you can research or watch a video to learn more about your music.</p>

            <img id="Calm" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p037rw86.jpg">
            <p id="Emotion">You've just started playing one of the if not the most difficult instrument in the world, <b>you <i>are</i> going to get frustrated.</b> Frustration is probably the top reason beginner violinists quit, don't let <i>that</i> be the reason you'd quit. When practicing, do what you can and take it slow at first - your inotation will never be perfect and won't be very good until one or two years. Vibrato could take from one month to a year to learn. Position should be something to get used to. Once again, you definetly are going to get frustrated when practicing the violin when you realize that's what's happening then take a brake for a while and try again later. When practicing make sure your not tired, make sure your ready, and make sure your motivated to get better.</p>

            <h1 id="SIX">6. Play With Confidence</h1>
            <img id="Smooth" src="https://dnan0fzjxntrj.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/7/1/20571_lsosimonrattle_markallan_515503.jpg">
            <p id="Confidence">Playing with confidence in a concert means the concert was good even if you made a big mistake, because even if you mess up at least you weren't scared when you did but instead played with enthusiasm and love in every note. The concert was good because you gave the people in the audience and yourself what everyone wanted - joy playing the instrument and happiness of hearing beautiful music from a lively group. Whether your going to a concert or playing the violin anywhere else, you need to play with confidence even if you may be nervous. Now, what does playing with confidence mean? It means you need to be excited to play to someone, you should <i>want</i> to play for someone. Don't be afraid to make long bows and mess up when practicing or on stage, I realize beginner violinists are afraid to move their bow too much which makes them sound scratchy and unclear and this is a senseless fear - When playing you need to be free and loose not tight, you need to want to make a sound. Move your hand, make a good <i>clear</i> sound then practice on your finger placement, etc.</p>

            <h1 id="FIVE">5. You Will Always Be Above/Below Others</h1>

            <p id="Stradivarius">Don't count on yourself becoming one of the best violinists in the world, because it is <b>very hard</b> (However not impossible). Instead focus on what you need to improve at the current moment, you might take inspiration from someone which is of course very good however I also see kids getting dissapointed and stressed when they can't play in a way others do. Beginner violinists will look up at someone else who may play the violin way better than themselves (Tutorial violin videos too) and think they themselves should be able to play like that in a month. This is not true, you will be able to play like someone else whenever it's time if you practice - Others keep trying to follow a tutorial video until they finally quit the violin, or they watch someone play and think they'll never play like that. Look at the differences, others might have had much more practice time than you, they might have a million dollar instrument, be happy that you can play the way you can just make sure to keep improving slowly and having the motivation to.</p>

            <img id="Queit" src="https://cdn.create.vista.com/api/media/medium/372345766/stock-photo-silhouette-professional-musician-playing-violin?token=">
            <p id="Peace">When practicing, you should have a queit comfortable area with enough light to read your music. You should be calm when practicing in this area with a place to put your violin when not practicing and you yourself need to feel comfortable. Although this is obvious, some kids would pick a place where they could get distracted (Mostly in school) or would pick a place where the atmosphere isn't good, lighting isn't good, etc. Be sure your in the best place to be practicing otherwise you might not gain much from practicing.</p>

            <p id="ViolinMovie">Really? Watching violins instead of practicing? Yes! (Of course practicing also). Watching people play the violin will help you a lot because you can see the way a composition is supposed to be played or you can see how people do vibrato, shifting, etc. Now that there is technology, always make sure to watch videos of your current practice piece being played if there is one because this will help you remember where there are certain parts of the song you should slow down or get queiter, maybe there is a certain part where you have to play a specific way and you didn't know - a video will help you a lot with practicing. Movies and other videos will also help you a lot, although may not be playing the specific piece you are they could - Firstly, show you a lot more about how violin is supposed to be played profesionally and help you understand more about the violin. Secondly, it could be entertaining.</p>

            <img id="Perfectyes" src="https://musicalinstrumenthire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/violin-sizing.jpg">
            <p id="thatone">When renting/buying/borrowing a violin you need to make sure its good for you. Make sure it is comfortable when putting on your chin (With the shoulder rest) and make sure if your buying one especially that the violin is high quality with good strings and not too beat up. Your violin should be the perfect size for you, usually a teacher would say which size to get otherwise you can follow a guide online (Click the image of the violin at the top of this site on the right for a online violin choosing guide). Your violin should make a good clear sound and easy for you to use.</p>

            <p id="Completion">Always before starting violin there should be a reason, you should want to play the violin there should be a motivational factor into why your getting into the violin - ask yourself what it is. Whether it's to play your cultures music, for your country, for your family/friends, or for yourself there is always a reason and that reason keeps making you to want to play the violin. You'll be getting better by time if you still have the motivation to, that's how your supposed to practice by wanting it yourself and not by someone telling you. You will get better in the violin if you <i>want</i> to.</p>
